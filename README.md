# WebCrawler
- The interface will ask for the product to be searched.

- When you press the button it will pass the string to the search engines, scraping them and generating two files so as not to lose the information on the way.

- Then it will read them to pass them to the table of the interface and to be able to interact with it, to see the links and prices, this filtering our product avoiding to have to make many different searches.

(A bit more direct than google shops imo).
